# Image to Sketch Converter (OpenCV)

Convert images into pencil-style sketches using Python and OpenCV.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How it works
The script converts an image to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur, and blends it to produce a pencil-sketch effect.

## Web Demo
A simple frontend allows users to upload an image and view the generated sketch directly in the browser.

The frontend communicates with a Flask API backend using `fetch` and `FormData`.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
python sketch.py
